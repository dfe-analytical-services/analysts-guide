  title: "Personal cluster with RStudio and `sparklyr`"

The sparklyr package can be inconsistent in how it handles connections, and its behavior may not always align with the guidance currently available to us. Due to this, weâ€™ve temporarily archived the instructions for connecting to Databricks via sparklyr.

If you are looking for a more stable connection, consider using [Personal cluster with RStudio and `odbc` / `DBI` page](databricks_rstudio_personal_cluster.html).
