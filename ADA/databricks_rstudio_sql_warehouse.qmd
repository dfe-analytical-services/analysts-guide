  title: "Connecting to Databricks from RStudio"
---

The following instructions will help you to set up a connection between your laptop and your Databricks SQL warehouse, which can then be used in RStudio to query data.

You can use data from the SQL warehouse in two different ways:

-   In the SQL editor or in notebooks via the Databricks environment
-   In RStudio, similarly to the way that you might currently use SQL Server

The `sparklyr` package can also be used from within RStudio as it converts the request for data to Spark SQL behind the scenes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pre-requisites

Before you start, you must have:

-   Access to the Databricks platform

-   Access to data in a SQL Warehouse on Databricks

-   R and RStudio downloaded and installed

-   The `ODBC` package installed in RStudio

If you do not have access to Databricks or a SQL Warehouse within Databricks, you can request this using [a service request form](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=74bc3be81b212d504f999978b04bcb0b).

If you do not have R or RStudio, you can find them both in the Software Centre. Note that you need both R **and** RStudio installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Process

There are three steps to complete before your connection can be established. These are:

-   Collecting the connection details from the DataBricks platform
-   Modifying your .Renviron file to establish a connection between RStudio and Databricks
-   Adding connection code to your existing scripts in RStudio

Each of these steps is described in more detail in the sections below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Setting up the ODBC driver

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Install the 'Simba Spark ODBC' driver from the Software Centre

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Open the Software Centre via the start menu

-   In the 'Applications' tab, click 'Simba Spark ODBC Driver 64-bit'

:::

-   Click install

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Get connection details for the SQL Warehouse from Databricks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To set up the connection you will need a few details from the SQL Warehouse within Databricks that you wish to connect to.

-   Log in to Databricks

-   Click on the 'SQL Warehouses' tab in the sidebar

::: {align="center"}
![](../images/databricks-SQL-warehouses.png)
:::

-   Click on the name of the warehouse you want to connect to, and click the 'Connection Details' tab

-   Make a note of the 'Server hostname', 'Port', and 'HTTP Path'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Get a personal access token from Databricks for authentication

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A personal access token is is a security measure that acts as an identifier to let Databricks know who is accessing information from the SQL warehouse. Access tokens are usually set for a limited amount of time, so they will need renewing periodically.

-   In Databricks, click on your email address in the top right corner, then click 'User settings'

-   Go to the 'Developer' tab in the side bar. Next to 'Access tokens', click the 'Manage' button

::: {align="center"}
![](../images/databricks-access-tokens.png)
:::

-   Click the 'Generate new token' button

-   Name the token, then click 'Generate'

::: callout-note
Note that access tokens will only last as long as the value for the 'Lifetime (days)' field. After this period the token will expire, and you will need to create a new one to re-authenticate.
:::

-   Make a note of the 'Databricks access token' it has given you

::: callout-warning
It is very important that you immediately copy the access token that you are given, as you will not be able to see it through Databricks again. If you lose this access token before pasting it into RStudio then you must generate a new access token to replace it.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Set up ODBC connection from your laptop

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now have all the information we need to setup a connection between our laptop and Databricks:

-   in the start menu, search 'ODBC' and open 'ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)'

-   on the 'User DSN' tab click the 'Add...' button

-   in the 'Create New Data Source' window, select 'Simba Spark ODBC Driver' and click 'Finish'

-   you will see the 'Simba Spark ODBC Driver DSN Setup' window shown below:

![](../images/odbc-driver-settings.png){fig-align="center"}

-   enter a 'Data Source Name'

::: callout-note
Choose a short and sensible data source name and note it down as this is what you will use to connect to Databricks through RStudio.
:::

-   enter a 'Description'

::: callout-note
As you can set up more than one cluster on Databricks, use the description to make clear which cluster this connection is for. The description shown below describes that this connection is using an 8 core cluster on Databricks Runtime Environment 13.
:::

Set the remaining options to the settings below:

-   enter the 'Server Hostname' for your cluster in the 'Host(s)' field (you noted this down in step 2)\
-   in the Port section, remove the default number and use the Port number you noted in step 2\
-   set the Authentication Mechanism to 'User Name and Password'\
-   enter the word 'token' into the 'User Name:' field, then enter your 'Databricks access token' in the 'Password' field\
-   change the Thrift Transport option to HTTP\
-   click the 'HTTP Options...' button and enter the 'HTTP Path' of your Databricks cluster, then click 'OK'\
-   click the 'SSL Options...' button and tick the 'Enable SSL' box, then click the 'OK' button\
-   click the 'Test' button to verify the connection has worked. You should see the following message:

![](../images/databricks-test-connection.png){fig-align="center"}

::: callout-note
If you get an error here, repeat steps 5.e.i -- 5.e.ix again and ensure all the values are correct.
:::

-   click the 'OK' button to exit the 'Test Results' window, then the 'OK' button in the 'Simba Spark ODBC Driver DSN Setup' window

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Establishing an RStudio connection using environment variables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `ODBC` package in RStudio allows you to connect to Databricks by creating and modifying four environment variables in your .Renviron file.

To set the environment variables, call `usethis::edit_r_environ()`. You will then need to enter the following information:

```         
DATABRICKS_HOST=adb-5037484389568426.6.azuredatabricks.net
DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID=<sql-warehouse-id>
DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE_PATH=<sql-warehouse-path>
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=<personal-access-token> 
DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_ID=<personal-cluster-id>
DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_PATH=<personal-cluster-path>
```

Once you have entered the details, save and close your .Renviron file. You will then need to restart your R session so the environmental variables you have just set are available.

::: callout-note
Everyone in your team that wishes to connect to the SQL Warehouse in Databricks and run your code must set up their .Renviron file individually, otherwise their connection will fail.
:::

The sections below describe where to find the information needed for each of the four environment variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Databricks host

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Databricks host is the instance of Databricks that you want to connect to. It's the URL that you see in your browser bar when you're on the Databricks site and should end in "azuredatabricks.net".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Databricks SQL Warehouse ID

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Databricks SQL warehouse ID is the warehouse containing data that you would like to use. To get the warehouse ID, follow these steps:

-   click 'SQL Warehouses' under the 'SQL' section of the left hand menu on Databricks
-   click on the warehouse name that you'd like to get the ID for
-   the warehouse ID is in brackets next to the warehouse name on the 'Overview' tab

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Databricks SQL Warehouse HTTP path

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Databricks SQL warehouse path is the http path that allows R to connect to the warehouse across the cloud. To find the warehouse path, follow these steps:

-   click 'SQL Warehouses' under the 'SQL' section of the left hand menu on Databricks
-   click on the warehouse name that you'd like to get the ID for
-   click on the 'Connection details' tab
-   the path is available in a box titled 'HTTP path'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Databricks Token

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Databricks token is the personal access token we generated in the [Get a personal access token from Databricks for authentication](/ADA/databricks_rstudio_sql_warehouse.html#get-a-personal-access-token-from-databricks-for-authentication) section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Personal Cluster ID

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cluster ID is the cluster that you'll be using to run your code.

To obtain this, follow these steps:

-   click 'Compute' in the Databricks menu, then click on your cluster's name
-   in the address bar, copy the string of characters between `clusters` and `configuration` in the URL. This is your cluster ID.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Personal Cluster path

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cluster path is the http path that allows R to connect to the cluster across the cloud. To find the cluster path, follow these steps:

-   click 'Compute' in the Databricks menu, then click on your clusters name
-   expand the 'Advanced options' menu at the bottom of the page
-   click the 'JDBC/ODBC' tab
-   the path is available in a box titled 'HTTP path' 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pulling data into RStudio from Databricks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have established a connection between Databricks and your laptop, and between Databricks and RStudio, you can add code to your existing scripts to pull data into RStudio for analysis. If you have connected to other SQL databases before, this code will look quite familiar to you.

To access the data, we will make use of the [`ODBC`](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/r-packages/odbc/) and [`DBI`](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/r-packages/dbi/) packages to establish a connection to the SQL warehouse. 

To pull in your data from a SQL warehouse, include the following code in your R Script:

```{r databricks_connect, eval=FALSE}
library(odbc)
library(DBI)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(
    odbc::databricks(),
    httpPath = Sys.getenv("DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE_PATH")
)

odbcListObjects(con)
```


To use a personal cluster instead simply alter the `DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE_PATH` to `DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_PATH` as below:

```{r databricks_connect, eval=FALSE}
library(odbc)
library(DBI)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(
    odbc::databricks(),
    httpPath = Sys.getenv("DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_PATH")
)

odbcListObjects(con)
```
