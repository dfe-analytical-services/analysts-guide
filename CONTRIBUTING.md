### Quarto guidance

For more information specific to how a quarto site works, and for
examples of what is possible within a static quarto site, see the main
[Quarto website](https://quarto.org/).

Hadley Wickham's book, [R for Data
Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html), gives the following
intro to Quarto:

> `"Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It allows you to create dynamic documents that weave together narrative text, code, and output, such as plots and tables."`

#### Visual Editor

The Visual Editor in RStudio offers a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You
Mean) interface for creating Quarto documents. These documents, saved as
.qmd files, are written using Markdown—a lightweight syntax for
formatting plain text. Specifically, Quarto employs Pandoc Markdown, an
enhanced version of Markdown, which supports a variety of elements such
as tables, citations, cross-references, footnotes, divs/spans,
definition lists, attributes, raw HTML/TeX, and more. Additionally,
Quarto allows for the execution of code cells with inline output
display. Although Markdown is designed to be straightforward, it still
necessitates learning some new syntax.

For those who are new to computational documents like .qmd files but
have experience with tools like Google Docs or MS Word, the visual
editor in RStudio is the most user-friendly way to begin working with
Quarto. In the visual editor, you can use the toolbar buttons to insert
images, tables, cross-references, and other elements.

#### Adding images (in the right folder, code to do so)

The visual editor also simplifies inserting images and customizing their
display. You can paste an image directly from your clipboard into the
visual editor, which will save a copy of the image in your project
directory and link to it. Alternatively, you can use the Insert \>
Figure / Image menu to browse for the image you want to insert or paste
its URL. This menu also allows you to resize the image, add captions,
alternative text, and links.

The visual editor offers many additional features that become evident as
you gain more experience with it.

Most importantly, while the visual editor displays your content with
formatting, it saves everything in plain Markdown. You can easily switch
between the visual and source editors to view and edit your content in
either format.

#### Adding links (within page, within site, external to site)\]

In Quarto, you can add links using the following Markdown syntax:

1.  Inline Links: \[Link Text\] `(https://example.com)`

2.  Reference Links: \[Link Text\]\[1\]

`[1]: https://example.com`

In Quarto, you can also include links within various contexts, such as
code blocks or embedded within other content structures, depending on
the complexity of your document. However, the basic Markdown link syntax
will generally cover most use cases.

![Example for adding
links](images/adding_links_example.png){width="300"}

#### Adding videos / other content

##### **Adding Videos**

You can embed videos in Quarto documents using HTML, Markdown, or
specialised Quarto syntax. Here are some methods:

1.  Using a shortcode:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< video url >}}
```

-   For example, here we embed a YouTube video:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc >}} 
```

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc >}}

2.  Embedding videos in other formats:

-   In HTML formats the video will be embedded within the document.
-   For other formats, a simple link to the video will be rendered.

##### **Adding Other Content**

-   **Audio Files**: You can embed audio files using the HTML <audio>
    tag.
-   **Interactive Content with HTML Widgets**: Quarto supports various
    HTML widgets that can add interactive content to your document.

##### Tips

-   **Relative Paths**: Use relative paths for local files to ensure
    your document remains portable.

In R, relative paths refer to file or directory paths specified in
relation to the current working directory. Relative paths help manage
current working files.

If you're struggling with running your files across different paths in
your working directories, then the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/)
package can sometimes help you solve those types of issues.

-   **Test Across Browsers**: Ensure multimedia content works across
    different browsers and devices.

-   **Output Formats**: Verify that multimedia elements render correctly
    in the intended output formats (HTML, PDF, etc.).

By following these methods, you can effectively add videos, images,
audio, and interactive content to your Quarto documents, enhancing their
informativeness and engagement.

#### Redirecting pages where changing / removing

Redirecting pages in a Quarto project for R involves creating
`a _quart.yml` configuration file where you can define redirects.

1.  **`Create/Edit_quarto.yml`** : Ensure you have a `_quarto.yml` file
    in your Quarto project.

2.  **`Add redirects`**: In `_quarto.yml`, define redirects like this: -
    From: `old-page.html` to: `new-page.html`

3.  **`Render Project`** : Run `quarto render` in your project directory
    to apply changes.

4.**`Verify`**: Test old URLs to ensure they redirect correctly.

This sets up URL redirects for pages that have changed or been removed
in your Quarto project.

#### Checking for broken links when changing headings

When changing headings in Quarto project, it's crucial to ensure that
all links referencing these headings are still correct. Here's a quick
guide to check for broken links:

1.  **Change Headings**: Update your headings in the relevant
    `.qmd files`.

2.  **Run Quarto's Built-in Link Checker**: Quarto has a built in
    feauture to check for broken links.

Run the following command in your project directory:

`quarto check`

This command will scan your project for broken links and report any
issues.

3.  **Manually Update Links**: If any broken links are reported, update
    them to match the new headings. Use the correct anchors, which
    typically follow the format `#new-heading-text`.

4.  **Re-render Project**: After updating links, re-render your project:
    `quarto render`

5.  **Double-Check**: Manually verify a few pages to ensure that the
    links work as expected.

### Example

If you changed a heading from `## Old Heading` to `## New Heading`, make
sure all links like `[link text](#old-heading)` are updated to
`[link text](#new-heading)`. By following these steps, you can
efficiently check for and fix broken links when changing headings in
your Quarto project.

#### Building locally before raising a pull request

Here's a streamlined guide for building your Quarto project locally
before raising a pull request (from the terminal):

1.  **Pull Latest Changes**: Make sure your local branch is up-to-date
    with the main branch. `git pull origin main`

2.  **Make Your Changes**: Edit your `.qmd` files or other relevant
    files in the project.

3.  **Build the Project Locally**: Render the entire project to catch
    any errors. `quarto render`

###### Note: While this guide presents a terminal-based workflow, there are equivalent commands available in the R console for those who prefer working within R. For example, you can use `quarto_preview()` in the R console to preview your Quarto project.

4.  **Check for Errors and Warnings**: Review the console output and fix
    any issues.

5.  **Preview the Project**: Open the generated files in a browser to
    ensure everything looks correct. `quarto preview`

6.  **Check for Broken Links**: Use Quarto’s link checker to find and
    fix broken links. `quarto check`

7.  **Commit Your Changes**: Add and commit your changes to your local
    repository. `git add . git commit -m "Describe your changes"`

8.  **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your feature branch.
    `git push origin your-feature-branch`

9.  **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your repository platform (e.g.,
    GitHub) and create a pull request from your feature branch to the
    main branch.

Following these steps ensures your changes are correctly implemented and
verified locally, minimising potential issues during the review process.

#### Changing the appearance of code blocks

You can modify the `highlight-style` element in the `quarto.yml` file to
change the display of code blocks using predefined themes. This will
change the appearance of all code snippets across the entire Analysts'
guide. The current theme is set to "printing" but there is a list of
other available themes [on the Quarto
website](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#highlighting).

Some things to be aware of before you make changes:

-   Some of the themes are adaptive, meaning that if you change the site
    view from dark mode to light mode then the theme will also change
    accordingly.

-   The appearance of code snippets will only change if the language
    (e.g. R, Python) is defined at the start of the snippet (e.g.
    ```` ``` {r connection_example, eval=FALSE} ````). Including
    `eval=FALSE` stops your code snippet from actually running. If no
    language is defined, the snippet appearance will need to be modified
    manually and this can cause some issues.

### Adding call out blocks

To add in call out blocks for text, use the built-in Quarto callouts as
follows:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
::: {.callout-note}
Text 
:::
```

There are five different types of callouts available: note, warning,
important, tip and caution. The name you use will be displayed at the
top of the box.

To customise the title of the callout box, add a title within the
callout code like this:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
::: {.callout-warning}
## Title of my warning
Text 
:::
```

You can find more information on formatting callout blocks [on the
Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

### Adding images from draw.io

You can create images, flowcharts, and diagrams using
[draw.io](http://draw.io). To add them to the Analysts' guide, we
recommend embedding them, by selecting File \> Embed \> HTML. The image
below shows the options that you should select when embedding a diagram

![](../images/embed-drawio.png)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the site, [search if an issue already
exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a
relevant [issue
form](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/analysts-guide/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing
issues](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/analysts-guide/issues)
to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are
welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

Key things to remember when making or proposing changes:

-   Where guidance already exists elsewhere it should be linked to
    rather than duplicated

-   When adding images, save them in the /images folder

-   When adding files for download, save them in the /resources folder -
    Don't commit rendered .html files for pages

-   If your changes remove or edit a pre-existing anchor link, consider
    how that will be redirected for users who may have bookmarked it

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Edit this page** at the bottom of the right hand table of
contents of any page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix,
or a broken link. This takes you to the `.Qmd` file where you can make
your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.

#### Make changes locally

1.  Clone or fork the repository.

2.  Open the repository in your editor of choice, e.g. R Studio.

3.  Create a working branch and start with your changes!

4.  Commit and push the changes to your working branch.

### Pull Request {#pull-request}

All pull requests should be made against the main branch.

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known
as a PR.

-   Don't forget to [link PR to
    issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
    if you are solving one.

Once you submit your PR, a repository admin will review your proposal.
We may ask questions or request additional information.

-   We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either
    using [suggested
    changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
    or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly
    through the UI. You can make any other changes and then commit them
    to your branch.

-   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
    [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

-   If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [Git
    tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help
    you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
