### Source data is acquired and stored sensibly

**What does this mean?** 

When we refer to 'source data', we take this to mean the data you use at the start of your process to create the underlying data files or analysis. Any cleaning at the end of a collection will happen before this. 

Legacy SQL servers will be decommissioned in 2026, and all data will be migrated into the Databricks Unity Catalog instead. As far as meeting the requirement to have all source data in a database, databases other than Databricks may be acceptable, though we can't support them in the same way.

In order for us to be able to have an end-to-end data pipeline where we can replicate our analysis across the department, we should store all of the raw data needed to create aggregate statistics in the Databricks platform. This includes any lookup tables and all administrative data from collections prior to any manual processing. This allows us to then match and join the data together in an end-to-end process. 


**Why do it?**

The principle is that this source data will remain stable and is the point you can go back to and re-run the processes from if necessary. If for any reason the source data needs to change, your processes will be set up in a way that you can easily re-run them to get updated outputs based on the amended source data with minimal effort.

Having all the data in one place and processing it in one place makes our lives easier, and also helps us when auditing our work and ensuring reproducibility of results.

**How to get started**

For resources to help you learn about Databricks and how to migrate your data into the Unity Catalog, please see our [ADA and Databricks documentation](../ADA/ada.html).
