### Automated high level checks

**What does this mean?**

Any data files that have been created will need to be quality assured. These checks should be automated where possible, so the computer is doing the hard work - saving us time, and to ensure their reliability.

Some teams are already making great progress with automated QA and realising the benefits of it. The Statistics Development Team are working with these to provide generalised code that teams can use as a starting point for automated QA. The intention is that teams can then run this as a minimum, before then looking to develop more area specific checks to the script and/or continue with current checking processes in tandem. If your team already use, or are working towards using, automated QA then get in touch as we'd be keen to see what you have.

It is assumed that when using R, automated scripts will output .html reports that the team can read through to understand their data and identify any issues, and save as a part of their process documentation.

For more information on general quality assurance best practice in DfE, see the [How to QA guide](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/how-to-qa/index.html).

Cam and Sarah ran a session introducing how to get started with automated QA in relation to RAP, slides are available on [GitHub](https://sarahmwong.github.io/intro-to-automating-QA/#1){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} or you can [watch the recording of the session](https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/57eab29d-afeb-4651-a9f5-687098b84d13).

The list of basic automated QA checks, with code examples can be found below and in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

* Checking for [minimum](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_minimum_values.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [maximum](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_maximum_values.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and [average](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_average_values.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} values across your data

* Checking for [extreme values and outliers](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_extreme_values.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

* Ensuring there are no [duplicate rows](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_duplicate_rows.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} or [duplicate columns](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_duplicate_columns.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

* Checking that where appropriate, [geographical subtotals add up to totals](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/check_LA_subtotals_vs_region.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (e.g. all the numeric values for LAs in Yorkshire and The Humber add up to the regional total)

* Basic [trend analysis using scatter plots](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa/blob/main/R/create_scatter_plot.R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, to help you spot outliers and help tell the story of your data.


The Statistics Development Team have developed [the QA app](https://rsconnect/rsc/dfe-published-data-qa/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to include some of these basic QA outputs.


**Why do it?**

Quality is one of the three pillars that our [code of practice](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/quality/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is built upon. These basic level checks allow us to have confidence that we are accurately processing the data.

Automating these checks ensures their accuracy and reliability, as well as being dramatically quicker than doing these manually.

**How to get started**

Try using our [template code snippets](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/automated-data-qa) to get an idea of how you could automate QA of your own publication files. A recording of our introduction to automated QA is also available at the top of the page.
