## What is RAP?

RAP are a way to create well documented, reproducible, quality analysis using the best tools available to us as analysts. In 2022, the Analysis Function published their [RAP strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/), which outlines the expectation that RAP should be "the default approach to analysis in government". Each department is expected to publish a RAP implementation strategy to explain how they are going to support analysts to embed RAP into their day to day work. You can view the [RAP implementation plans for all departments, including DfE](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/departmental-rap-plans/) on the Analysis Function website.

A session introducing RAP was held for the Data Insight and Statistics Division in December 2020. The slides can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjrace/introduction-to-rap){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, or you can [watch the recording](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/lvewp00086/WorkplaceDocuments/Statistics%20Services%20Unit/Statistics%20Development%20Team/Stream%20Migrated%20Videos/Recordings/An%20introduction%20to%20RAP-20201217_024855-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=Fz1gXt).

### Benefits of RAP

------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the [Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/), using RAP should:

-   improve the quality of the analysis
-   increase trust in the analysis by producers, their managers and users
-   create a more efficient process
-   improve business continuity and knowledge management

In DfE, we have worked with ‘analytical pipelines’ for many years. RAP aims to automate these pipelines wherever possible, to increase efficiency and accuracy, while creating a clear audit trail to allow analyses to be re-run easily. This allows us to focus on where human input can really add value. RAP reduces human error, removing the need to copy and paste between documents or make manual edits to code each time it's re-run. Ultimately, RAP can reduce the burden on us by removing the boring stuff; what’s not to like?!

### RAP expectations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAP is now the default approach to analysis in DfE. All analysts are expected to follow RAP principles in their work, proportionate to the task at hand. This includes ad-hoc analysis, one-off reports and one-off statistics production, as well as repeatable processes. You can find more information on expectations of government analysts on the [RAP expectations page](../RAP/rap-expectations.html).

### RAP principles

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAP principles represent best practice in analytical work and should be our default approach wherever possible. While not every principle will apply to every situation, many are universally beneficial and can be adopted even in ad-hoc or one-off pieces of work.

Cross-government RAP champions have laid out a [minimum level of RAP](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/rap_mvp_maturity_guidance/blob/master/Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines-MVP.md) to aim for. In DfE, we have used these to develop two sets of RAP principles to reflect the different needs of statistics production processes and general analysis. 

The [RAP for statistics principles](../RAP/rap-statistics.html) reflect where processes are often repeated and structured, allowing for more automation and standardisation.

The [RAP for general analysis principles](../RAP/rap-analysis.html) reflect that general analysis can be more varied, but still benefits from applying RAP principles proportionally.

Always applicable RAP principles include:

-   Documentation

-   Sensible folder and file structure

-   Source data is acquired and stored sensibly

Principles applicable in more specific situations include:

-   Recyclable code for future use

-   Project specific automated sense checks

### RAP support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find support available for RAP on the [RAP support page](../RAP/rap-support.html), and answers to common questions on the [RAP FAQS page](../RAP/rap-faqs.html).
