However, in order to ensure a fit for purpose service, not all EES \ndata will be accessible via the API, and any that is will need to pass a higher bar for quality. In effect API data\n**must** meet all the criteria laid out in our [Open data standards guidance](../statistics-production/ud.qmd).\n\nWhilst the EES data screener tests for a significant base level of data quality and consistency, there are some \nadditional criteria that are either too awkward to test for rigorously using the screener or are tested for but\nreturned as warnings. Data intended for the EES API must pass all the base level screener tests, plus a number\nthat only return warnings, plus manual inspection by the platform gatekeepers. These are primarily:\n\n- Strict tidy data structures - i.e. appropriate use of filters and indicators.\n- Standardised filter col_names and items consistent with the harmonised standards.\n- Standardised indicator col_names meeting the naming standards.\n- Character limits for col_names and filter items.\n\nExamples of these that do and don't meet the API data standards are provided in the following sections.\n\n## API publishing checklist\n\nThe following are steps to follow when planning on publishing a data set via the API:\n\n### At least a few weeks / month before publication\n\n- Check column names and filter items against the data dictionary\n- Review data structure and confirm (new) column names with the Explore education statistics team\n- Alert key known end users of any changes to existing API data sets or new data API data sets (e.g. Opportunity Mission dashboard team, Compare school and college performance)\n\n### Prior to approval of the release on EES\n\n- Screen data files\n- Upload data files to your release as normal\n- Submit a request to [explore.statistics@education.gov.uk](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) to activate the files as API data sets\n- Once activated, follow normal sign-off process\n\n## Character limits for col_names and filter items\n\nCharacter limits for fields in data uploaded to the API are:\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| Element                          | Character limit |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Location codes                   | 30 characters   |\n| Filter / indicator column names  | 50 characters   |\n| Filter / indicator column labels | 80 characters   |\n| Filter items / location names    | 120 characters  |\n\n: Character limits on column names, column labels and filter items.\n\n:::\n\n## Tidy data structure\n\nThe key thing on tidy data structure is to avoid filter items being included within indicator col_names. Where \nyou have collections of related terms appearing in indicator names (e.g. male, female, total), then these \nshould be translated into a filter column, with the data being pivoted.\n\nAll data uploaded to EES should be in a tidy data structure form, but this is more strictly regulated for data intended for use with the API. More information on building tidy data structures can be found in the [tidy data structure section](../statistics-production/ud.html#tidy-data-structure).\n\nThe following give examples of how different examples of data structures could be adapted.\n\n\n### Example 1 - Three metrics with a single filter\n\n#### Example of bad practice\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| school_count  | pupil_count_male | pupil_count_female | pupil_count_total | pupil_percent_male | pupil_percent_female | pupil_percent_total |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| 2             | 120               | 130                 | 250               | 48                  | 52                    | 100                  |\n\n: Pupil counts and percentages in non-tidy format\n\n:::\n\n#### Example of good practice\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| sex                | school_count  | pupil_count  | pupil_percent  |\n|--------------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Male               | 2             | 30           | 60             |          \n| Female             | 2             | 40           | 80             |         \n| Total              | 2             | 50           | 100            |                  \n\n: Pupil counts and percentages in tidy format\n\n:::\n\n### Example 2 - Metrics with hierarchical filters\n\n#### Example of bad practice\n\nThe following would not be accepted for publication via the API.\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| attendance |overall_absence | authorised_absence | unauthorised_absence | attendance_percent |overall_absence_percent | authorised_absence_percent | unauthorised_absence_percent |\n|------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| 180        | 20             | 12                 | 8                    | 90         | 10             | 6                 | 4                    | \n\n: Attendance statistics in non-tidy format\n\n:::\n\n#### Example of good practice\n\nThe following would be accepted for publication via the API. In this case, creating a hierarchical filter combination allows a clear representation of the data.\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| attendance_status  | attendance_type      | session_count  | session_percent |\n|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Attendance         | Total                | 180            | 90              |\n| Absence            | Total                | 20             | 10              |\n| Absence            | Authorised absence   | 12             | 6               |\n| Absence            | Unauthorised absence | 8              | 4               |         \n\n: Attendance statistics in tidy format with hierarchical filters\n\n:::\n\n### Example 3 - Metrics with non-compatible filters\n\n#### Example of bad practice\n\nIn the example below, the different metrics contain different types of values that are split \nby very different filters. Specifically pupil counts and pupil percents are split into \ngrade thresholds, whereas the score based metrics are not. \n\nThe following would not be accepted for publication via the API.\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| pupil_count_grade9to5 | pupil_count_grade9to4 | pupil_count_grade9to1 | pupil_percent_grade9to5 | pupil_percent_grade9to4 | pupil_percent_grade9to1 | progress8_score_male | progress8_score_female | progress8_score |attainment8_score_male | attainment8_score_female | attainment8_score |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| 30                     | 40                     | 50                     | 60                       | 80                       | 100                      | 0.2                  | 0.21                   | 0.21            |0.09                  | 0.08                   | 0.10            |\n\n: Attainment grade rates and scores in non-tidy format\n\n:::\n\n#### Example of pivoting leading to excessive duplications and not applicable characters\n\nIf we were to try and pivot \nthe above data as one file, it would lead to an unreasonably large number of cells with no \nvalid entries (i.e. large numbers of z's). For example, pivoting might create something \nlike the following table, which suffers from both a large number of not applicable \ncolumns and duplication of data unnecessarily.\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| sex    | grade_range        |accountability_measure | pupil_count  | pupil_percent  | score_average |\n|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Total  | Grades 9-5         | z                     | 30           | 60             | z             |\n| Total  | Grades 9-4         | z                     | 40           | 80             | z             |\n| Total  | Grades 9-1         | z                     | 50           | 100            | z             |\n| Total  | z                  | Attainment 8          | 50           | 100            | 0.21          |\n| Female | z                  | Attainment 8          | 50           | 100            | 0.21          |\n| Male   | z                  | Attainment 8          | 50           | 100            | 0.20          |\n| Total  | z                  | Progress 8            | 50           | 100            | 0.08          |\n| Female | z                  | Progress 8            | 50           | 100            | 0.08          |\n| Male   | z                  | Progress 8            | 50           | 100            | 0.09          |\n\n: Example of pivoted data showing excessive duplicated and not applicable fields.\n\n:::\n\n#### Example of good practice\n\nThe following would be accepted for publication via the API.

These are being built iteratively as more data is put forward for the API, so if the current standards don't cater to your data set, you can contribute to building the harmonised standards for others to follow.\n\nThe standards can be used to create individual filter columns or combined filters (i.e. breakdown_topic / breakdown_topic).\n\nAreas for which harmonised standards are currently available are:\n\n- [establishment / school / provider characteristics](../statistics-production/ud.html#establishment-characteristics)\n- [ethnicity](../statistics-production/ud.html#ethnicity)\n- [sex and gender](../statistics-production/ud.html#sex-and-gender)\n- [special educational needs](../statistics-production/ud.html#special-educational-needs)\n\nAreas which are currently under development are:\n\n- attainment metrics\n- disadvantaged status\n- free school meal status\n\nWe encourage contributions to and feedback on all of the above and any other filter topic.\n\n### Examples of common non-standard filter col_names\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| Non-standard                | Potential standard equivalents     |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| ethnicity                   | ethnicity_major, ethnicity_minor   |\n| characteristic_sex          | sex                                |\n| school_type                 | establishment_type, establishment_type_group or education_phase |\n| pupil_sen_status            | sen_status                         |\n| characteristic_primary_need | sen_primary_need                   |\n| characteristic_topic        | breakdown_topic, breakdown_topic_establishment |\n| characteristic              | breakdown, breakdown_establishment |\n\n: Example non-standard col_names and their potential equivalents in the standardised framework.\n\n:::\n\n## Standardised indicator col_names\n\nIndicators should be named in line with the [indicator naming conventions set out in the open data standards](../statistics-production/ud.html#indicator-names).\n\n### Examples of common non-standard indicator col_names\n\n::: {.table-responsive}\n\n| Non-standard                           | Potential standard equivalents           |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| number_of_pupils                       | pupil_count                              |\n| NumberOfLearners, NumLearners          | pupil_count, learner_count               |\n| total_male, total_female               | pupil_count (plus sex filter)            |\n| pt_SEN_support                         | pupil_percent (plus SEN status filter)   |\n| num_provider, num_providers            | establishment_count                      |\n| no_schools, num_schools, total_schools | establishment_count                      |\n| num_inst, total_institutions, number_institutions, inst_count | establishment_count |\n\n: Example non-standard indicator col_names and their potential equivalents in the standardised framework.\n\n:::\n\n",
