<p class="text-muted">Guidance on understanding and engaging with the users of published statistics</p>

---

# Introduction

--- 
    
User engagement is about building sustainable relationships and feedback loops between statistics producers, users (and potential users) of statistics and other relevant stakeholders.

Being user centred is a key departmental priority. It's critical that we actively engage with the users of our statistics. There are thousands of users out there and teams should be actively be getting feedback on their publications from a variety of users - policy colleagues, local authorities, schools, media, and the general public to name but a few.

The [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) states that:

*“users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted on, and their use of statistics supported”*. 

Producers of statistics will only know whether this element of quality continues to be achieved by regularly engaging with a full range of users.

## USER hub


The User Support and Engagement Resource (USER) hub is now available on the [GSS website](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/user-support-and-engagement-resource-hub/). This is a central resource to help producers of statistics develop the knowledge, skills and techniques needed to engage effectively with their audiences.

## Case studies


### Explore Education Statistics service

---

Explore Education Statistics (EES) was born from a [discovery project](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/721729/HiveIT_-_DfE_dissemination_discovery.pdf), where the emphasis of the discovery was to understand who the users of the Department’s official statistics are, what they need, and where the DfE are currently meeting, exceeding or failing to meet those needs. 

**Initial user research**

We spoke to over 90 users directly, via 1 to 1 sessions or workshops and had over 130 survey responses. We used this research to create user personas and user stories which we then assessed ourselves against to see how well we were meeting those needs - the result of this was a recommendation that we needed to do something better.

**The alpha phase**

Following the discovery, we moved to the alpha phase, where we built prototypes and carried out extensive user testing to firm up the functionality that might be required - focusing on different user journeys and the user experience at each step. 

**The private beta phase**

We then passed a GDS service assessment where our approach was tested against the [GDS service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) before moving into the private beta phase where we started building the service for real. 

**User testing**

We user-tested every bit of the journey thoroughly and used feedback from users to iterate on the functionality we were making available. User testing was primarily through 1 on 1 sessions where users would be set activities to work through and we would watch how the user clicked through each part of the relevant journey and to ask what they might expect to see at any different steps of the process - both when creating/publishing statistics releases and using releases after publishing. We also ran workshops and carried out user surveys to collect as much evidence as possible, for more information on this take a look at the [write up of our private beta phase on Hive IT's website](https://hiveit.co.uk/our-work/dfe-private-beta/).

![](../images/dfe-beta-engagements.jpg)

**EES goes live**

In March 2020 we were given the green light via a GDS service assessment to move into our public beta phase. That’s when we started using the service for real and teams started publishing statistics via EES only. Ongoing user feedback has been really important throughout public beta as it has helped us move the service from a minimal viable product to one that works in the best way possible for everyone. We also use this engagement to help us understand how well we are meeting our KPIs, which we review regularly to see how well we are meeting the original aims of the service thinking back to our [original discovery](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/721729/HiveIT_-_DfE_dissemination_discovery.pdf) and what users told us they needed. 

**Ongoing feedback routes**

There are a number of ongoing feedback routes open to users during the public beta phase of the service:

* Beta banner (service focus)
Users can submit feedback through the beta banner from any EES page, and responses are managed by the statistics development team. Feedback so far has mostly been aimed at the service functionality more generally but we do regularly get publication specific feedback which we share with the relevant teams. 

* Formal user testing (service focus)
Our EES team will speak to users via user testing sessions to help inform future iterations to functionality.

* In-release feedback requests (publication focus)
Some teams have been including specific calls for feedback within their release pages e.g. the [apprenticeships and traineeships publication](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/apprenticeships-and-traineeships) 

* Google analytics
We collect user analytics to help us understand what users are doing with our statistics. This information is shared with production teams via our [EES analytics app](https://rsconnect/rsc/ees-analytics/).

### School places local authority scorecard

---

In 2021 the annual [Local Authority School Places Scorecard](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/local-authority-school-places-scorecards) publication was cancelled, due to Covid- 19, allowing time for user-engagement and development of the scorecard. This is a dashboard publication allowing users to select a specific local authority in England, to view it’s progress in providing quality school places. 

Firstly, internal feedback was sought and received, and generally users found the Scorecard a useful tool. Longer-term additions were identified, however short-term development was also needed to improve the accessibility of the Scorecard so this was the first developmental focus. The Scorecard has been previously published as an excel-based dashboard, however this method of publication was no longer viable due to new rules and regulations for official statistics publications. 

A new platform was therefore needed and R shiny was suggested as an accessible platform. A new version of a previously published scorecard was produced in R shiny. This was then published externally to gather feedback from users to check they could obtain the required information. 

The scorecard contained a link to a short survey and over 90 internal and external users responded (after email invitations were sent allowing a month to complete).  Most users found the R shiny version easier to use compared to the excel based dashboard which was positive. Suggestions for improvement were gathered and quite a few users mentioned they missed the one-page format of the excel scorecard (the R shiny version has tabs to get to some visualisations) and found some of the newer charts slightly confusing. Therefore solutions were proposed e.g. a downloadable one page PDF summary and alternative charts/clearer guidance. Development work is still ongoing to ensure users can gather the information they need from the scorecard.

### CIN-CLA outcomes statistical release

---

In 2020 we created a new statistical release which incorporated changes to the annual [Outcomes for children looked after by LAs](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-looked-after-children) statistical release and outcomes within the [Characteristics of children in need](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-children-in-need) statistical release. Improving these statistics was a commitment made at the end of the [CIN review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-in-need-of-help-and-protection-data-and-analysis). 

As part of the review of the National Statistics, an ad-hoc release was published [(Outcomes of children in need including looked after children)](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/outcomes-of-children-in-need-including-looked-after-children) and we asked users to submit feedback on the proposals through the running of a consultation via Gov.UK to which people could respond [(Children in need and looked after children statistics: proposed changes)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-in-need-and-looked-after-children-statistics-proposed-changes). 

We involved policy colleagues (including policy analysts) in the proposed changes ahead of publishing. We engaged with colleagues across the department to identify known users and user groups and notified them of the request for feedback on the proposals. We also followed up with a reminder as we got closer to the deadline. 

As part of this process, we had a meeting with the main stakeholders (the board of the National Association of Virtual School Heads). These key stakeholders were very keen to respond to the proposals but were having difficulty with resource and time to provide a comprehensive response, so we agreed to have a meeting to talk through everything and we took notes. 

Reaching out to users and actively engaging with them produced a great result - we received a wide range of feedback from a range of sources including previously unknown users. We received external and internal feedback. We published the results of the feedback on the proposals on gov.uk, including a summary of the feedback received and what we were able to incorporate into the new publication. This was not an official Government consultation and we had to negotiate with gov.uk on how to publish the documents. We were advised that going forward, it would be preferable for user engagement of this type to be published alongside the statistical releases as part of the new EES platform. For any further information contact Bree Waine.

# ONS strategy

---

The ONS published a [user engagement strategy](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in February 2021.  

The strategy sets out that many producers of statistics are already carrying out regular and effective user engagement. The strategy aims to build on this good work to embed user engagement as an essential part of a statistician’s role. The strategy sets out a vision and addresses the barriers to effective user engagement via three goals:

1.	Collaboration – collaborate across boundaries to offer a more coherent user experience

2.	Capability – build capability and equip producers of statistics with the practical skills and tools to deliver effective user engagement activities

3.	Culture – strengthen our culture and ensure user engagement is always an ongoing and essential part of a statistics producer’s role

The launch of the strategy, as well as two further videos on the value of user engagement are embedded below:

# DfE user engagement strategy

---

DfE are working with ONS and others to consider how to take forward work in this area.  DfE have put together an initial statement (note that this is in draft and should only be used as a guide internally):

>Work to understand and engage our users is vital to ensuring statistics are suitably and best communicated, and help the department in continuously reflecting and improving products and its services.  DfE welcomes the ONS strategy and collective focus on user engagement.
>
>As part of our efforts to meet wider user needs, the Department has undertaken [extensive user research](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/721729/HiveIT_-_DfE_dissemination_discovery.pdf) over the past few years in development of the new Explore Education Statistics platform to disseminate our statistics. We continue to develop this platform in line with user research and feedback. Through the intelligent use of supporting analytics, we are learning more about how our wide range of users find and use statistics, and how best to tailor our outputs to meet their needs.  This will help us embed user need even more strongly into our statistics development.
>
>In addition and more broadly, the department is working with ONS Best Practice Team to consider guidance around user engagement and how best to take forward the strategy for the department.  In line with this, as part of these developments we will be reviewing and refreshing our current [public-facing user engagement strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/287444/User_engagement_policy.pdf) which will then be reviewed annually.

Teams are encouraged to already start to think about who their users are, the channels they use to understand their needs and the user experience. 

Publication teams should keep abreast of [user analytics](user-analytics.html) to understand more about how users use and access their statistics and whether further improvements could be made. 

In addition, teams should also think about the ways they can glean feedback on their publication(s), this may include internal checks regards enhancements such as participating in [content design scrum(s)](scrums.html).

## Consultations


If you are considering changes to your publication and are contemplating a formal consultation do get in touch with [Statistics HoP office](mailto:Hop.statistics@education.gov.uk) early on to discuss.

For background information about consultation, please see:
* [Code of Practice on Consultations](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/100807/file47158.pdf) - please bear in mind this was written back in 2008 so certain aspects may have been updated but the background and principles do remain the same.
* [Consultation principles: guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance)


Examples of previous consultations:

## Surveys


We routinely publish statistical releases, but who is using these and why?  It’s important to understand your user types and need, so we (public and department) can get best value from what we do.  Using user insights can help us to continually improve our products and services. 

Having a survey with your releases is a great way to glean this feedback.

The ONS has published [10 top tips for creating a user feedback survey](../resources/2022_02_14_questionaire_toptips.docx) if you want more information on creating a survey. You can also preview an example of [results from a survey of statistics users](../resources/Survey_Results.docx) to see how useful it can be to gain insights into the users of your statistics.

It would be great to include your examples too, as well as capture your lessons learned and tips, so do [send these to us](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk).
