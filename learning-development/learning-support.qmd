<p class="text-muted">A collection of useful learning resources, and information on support and resources to get you started</p>

As analysts and statistics producers, we require a variety of tools to efficiently and reliably work with our data. Below are the recommended tools that give us the most power to do what we need. These have large user communities in DfE, and are already working in our current IT setup.

For best practice when using software and coding in our process, see our [guidance on RAP expectations](../RAP/rap-expectations.html) and the [DfE Good Code Practice guide](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/good-code-practice/index.html).

## Email support

 * [statistics.development@education.gov.uk](mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk)  
 * 9-5, aim to reply between 1-2 days.

## Technical workshops

We currently offer two in person workshops covering specific technical skills in practice. Each workshop is around 3 hours long, and you will work in small groups. We travel to deliver workshops based on demand, so please get in touch and let us know if you'd like to join the waiting list in your area for one or both of the sessions. 

Our current workshops are:

**Introduction to Git and Azure DevOps**

In this workshop, we cover:

*	What are git, Azure DevOps and GitHub and what are the differences?
*	How can they help your work?
*	How to start working with git and DevOps in the DfE ecosystem
*	Managing projects and tasks with DevOps Boards
*	Basic version control with git â€“ add/stage, commit, push and pull
*	Working with branches
*	Tracking changes and who made them
*	Merging, pull requests and merge conflicts

**Introduction to R and RAP** 

In this workshop, we cover:

* Setting up an R project
* Writing your own functions
* Aggregating & filtering data
* Using if statements
* Joining data
* Using R to run SQL 
* Creating plots (with ggplot2)

Contact [statistics.development@education.gov.uk](mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk) to register interest in workshops happening at your site or to request new topics!

## Partnership programme

 *	Dedicated resource to support development work, either building skills or working on analytical or statistical outputs.
 *	A short-term project with an agreed set of goals and timescale decided as part of an initiation meeting.
 * Contact statistics.development@education.gov.uk if you're interested in finding out more about the support we can give.

## Specific resources

We also have specific learning resources and materials for [SQL](../learning-development/sql.html), [R](../learning-development/r.html), and [Git](../learning-development/git.html)

# General resources

---

**Google and other web-search engines are the single most powerful learning resource out there**, whether it leads you to a Stack Overflow answer to your problem, or to an online training course, it will have your needs covered. We appreciate that it can be daunting and overwhelming at first though, which is why we're pooling together links to particularly relevant resources on this page. Let us know if there's any you'd like to see added!

- [The DfE Analytics Academy online R training course](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/AnalyticsAcademy798){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - walks you through how to get set up with R, as well as setting tasks using DfE data to learn fundamental skills in R.

- [How to QA](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/how-to-qa/index.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - a general guide to quality assurance best practice in DfE.

- [DfE Data Science resource tool](https://rsconnect/rsc/DS-Resources/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - a bank of learning materials, from coffee and coding talks to online guidebooks.

- [ESFA guide to using R and Git](https://rsconnect/rsc/esfa-r-training/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - take you from the beginning, teaches you how to use RStudio and later on even includes some information on Shiny apps and more complex topics. For more information on RShiny apps, join the [R Shiny Developers teams group](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A311ec2e4d46b4dd38f0d61f05fb93383%40thread.skype/tab%3A%3A1fc89e11-fa70-473d-b993-df467ca0d459?groupId=b95c605d-8fbc-4e4d-9a76-2f7d1c55e70a&tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9).

- [Connor Quinn's resources for Data Engineering](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/sarpi/g/SitePages/DataEngineeringResources.aspx){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - for more advanced SQL and database resources this is a fantastic place to go.

- [General data science resources](https://github.com/Chris-Engelhardt/data_sci_guide){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - includes plenty of open-source resources for R and SQL, with Python, Git, and shell included in there too.

- [Awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [awesome R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - another great bank of learning resources.

- [Data Science week streams](https://web.microsoftstream.com/group/df01862c-7ad4-4f25-b7f2-df7353af52a9){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - a variety of talks across Data Science within the department.

- [DfE Quality Assurance wiki](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/sarpi/g/SitePages/Quality-Assurance.aspx){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} -  much of this is aimed at areas that use modelling, plenty of it is applicable to how we QA our data too.

- [David Sands' Boons of R and Git](https://psysandsy.github.io/boons-r-git.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - a helpful guide on why R and Git are worth your time.

For more information on how to use these tools in analysis and statistics publications, please see the [processes and RAP](../RAP/rap-statistics.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} page.


This is by no means a finite list of resources, we want this to be added to and for it to develop over time - if you have any resources that you think could be added then we'd love to hear from you, so please email us at [statistics.development@education.gov.uk](mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk). 


If you are stuck at all, have any questions, want to find a resource, or even just want a second pair of eyes to double check something, contact us using the envelope in the top left corner and we'll be more than happy to help.
