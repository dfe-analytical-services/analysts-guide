Our analytical L&D offer includes full enterprise access to [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). This page contains a tailored set of DataCamp learning paths designed to support your development as an analyst in the Department for Education (DfE).

## What is DataCamp? 

DataCamp is an online learning platform focused on data and analytics skills. It offers over 400 interactive courses across Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, machine learning, data engineering, and more. The platform is designed to be hands-on: less theory, more doing. You code directly in the browser, get instant feedback, and can apply your learning through real-world projects and assessments.

## How do I get access to DataCamp? 

If you’d like a license, please email datacamp.requests@education.gov.uk copying your line manager. We expect everyone requesting access to have a development conversation with their manager, outlining how they plan to use - and are using - the platform to support their learning and development, making sure this is captured in their personal L&D plan.

## What are learning tracks? 

Learning tracks are sets of courses put together using DataCamp to help you build the right skills. These tracks draw on DataCamp's extensive course offerings to build competencies aligned with the Government Statistical Service (GSG) framework.

Each track is tailored to different levels of technical skills and experience, helping you decide which track would be best for you. You'll find estimated duration per course and per track to help you plan your time, and a special AI for All track to get everyone up to speed on foundational AI concepts. Use this page to identify the track that best fits your current goals and needs and head over to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) to start learning!
