Accessibility tools you can use

If wanting to check anything around colour:
	- Contrast - webaim / https://jansensan.github.io/color-contrast-matrix/
	- Colour blindness -
	- Colour blindness simulation - 
	- Greyscale - 

Helpful browser addins

These 'bookmarklets' are bookmarks that instead of saving a URL to a page, save a piece of Javascript code that executes on the page you are looking at, usually to highlight specific mark up. Very nifty!

	- Links

Free accessibility tools
	- Axe devtools, chrome extension / free download, we recommend (and I believe GDS tend to recommend too)
	- Google Lighthouse, lowest effort, and will catch some basic things, though doesn't cover everything

Worth also noting that no automated tools fully cover accessibility, manual testing is always required, so if you want to do manual testing have a look at:

Screen reader
	- NVDA (free to download)

Voice activation
	- Dragon is a paid for licence, though available through the empathy lab
