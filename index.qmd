This website is a guide aimed at anyone working in analysis or statistics in the Department for Education (DfE). It details best practice and learning resources across a number of areas listed out on this page.

If viewed in its entirety, it provides a walk-through guide for statisticians from processing to publication, as well as being a single reference point that is easy to navigate if you just need to check on a specific part of the process, link off to other resources, or access specific guidance.

There is already a wealth of resources out there, and therefore this site unashamedly aims to pool the relevant resources into one place. There are some things that this site does not yet have, it will develop and change over time. 

We hope it can prove a useful resource for everyone from the most experienced right through to those just starting out. If you have any feedback, suggested additions, or wish to challenge any of the guidance, please contact us using the envelope button in the top right corner.

## Our resources



We also have a number of other applications for statistics production teams to use to help them in their processes, they can be accessed at the links below when using a DfE device.



### EES data screening app



This application allows you to screen your data files against the underlying data standards for Official and National statistical publications. If your file passes the checks it also gives you some basic options for exploring the data in the file.

 - [Data screener code on GitHub](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfe-published-data-qa){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}



### EES analytics



There is an R Shiny dashboard that provides access to the Google Analytics data for the Explore Education Statistics platform.
